    "# Introduction to Surface Waves\n",
    "It is well known that electromagnetic waves propagating through space are solutions to Maxwell's equations.  A special, but very important subset of these waves, are plane waves oscillating at some frequency $\\nu$ or angular frequency $\\omega=2\\pi\\nu$.  The electric and magnetic field of these waves oscillate in phase and in a plane, orthogonally to each other and to the direction of propagation.  Waves that oscillate transverseley to the direction of propagation are called *transverse waves*.  A diagram indicating the arrangement of a typical propagating plane wave is shown below. In the figure the wave is said to have \"linear polarisation\" because the E-field oscillates linearly along one of the transverse axes.\n",

    "Surface waves in contrast propagate along the interface between a dielectric and a real metal.  It is useful to think of the metal as a \"gas\" of electrons and the surface wave a train of charge-density compressions and rarefactions (analogous to a sound wave in air).  The charge-density wave in the electron gas acts as a *longitudinal wave* in which the oscillations are in the same direction as the propagation.  In the figure below the + and - regions at the interface indicate alternating compressions and rarefactions of charge.  These charge-density waves in turn provide the sources and sinks of electric fields that originate and terminate at the charge-density maxima and minima.  The label $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{SW}}$ denotes the wavelength of the surface wave and $E_{\\mathrm{SW}}(x,z)$ denotes the surface wave electric field.  Note that the $E_z$ component of E-field is discontinuous at the interface and that the E-field is *not* perpendicular to the direction of propagation along $x$.  Note also that the E-field falls off exponentially in the $\\pm z$ direction and propagates *only* along the interface.\n",

    "## A Historical Note on Electromagnetic Surface Waves\n",
    "The impetus for the study of electromagnetic surface waves began with the development of radio communication near the end of the nineteenth century.  Ordinary Maxwellian \"space\" waves  cannot directly propagate beyond the horizon, although Marconi had been able to demonstrate long-range radio communication including transatlantic messaging between 1899 and 1901.  A possible explanation for this successful over-the-horizon transmission was the excitation and propagation of electromagnetic waves at the air-earth or air-sea interface that could be \"guided\" over the curvature of the planet.  It was therefore necessary to find solutions to Maxwell's equations that could explain the observations.  Stimulated by Arnold Sommerfeld's analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation along a single conducting wire in 1899, his student Johann Zenneck presented a paper on planar surface electromagnetic waves in 1907.  Zenneck found that Maxwell's equations had a solution corresponding to a wave coupled to a flat surface interface at the boundary between a dielectric (air) and a medium with finite conductivity (salt water). The configuration used by Zenneck is illustrated in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Fig 7.1_ZenneckWave.png\" alt=\"Zenneck Wave\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon after Zenneck's article appeared Sommerfeld again published an influential paper in 1909 in which he analysed the propagation of radio waves along the surface of the earth. He considered a vertical oscillating dipole (radio antenna) perpendicularly positioned to the interface between two media: one dielectric, the other conducting.  Sommerfeld studied secondary waves produced by the discontinuity at the interface between air and land, considered as a weakly conductive material. His analysis showed that the Hertz vector $\\mathbf{\\Pi}$, that describes the electromagnetic field in each medium is given by the sum of two fields, $P$ and $Q$ corresponding to two waves. The wave $Q$ represents a space propagating wave and $P$ a surface guided wave. For long distances $R$ from the source, $Q$ varies as $(1/R)$, where $R=\\sqrt{(r^2+z^2)}$, (see the figure above for a definition of the coordinates) while $P$ varies asymptotically as $1/\\sqrt{r}$ and is confined to the Earth's surface.  Over the course of the next two decades a controversy arose over the existence of the so-called Zenneck waves because Sommerfeld's original analysis contained a sign error, and it was found that it was difficult to excite the surface-guided wave with practical antenna sources or to detect and distinguish the true surface wave from the spatially propagating wave very close to the surface.  In any event, as far as long-distance wireless communication was concerned, the whole question became irrelevant when it was discovered that reflection from the ionosphere was the principal agent responsible for over-the-horizon radio transmission.\n"

    "## Plasmon Surface Waves at Optical Frequencies\n",
    "Recent interest in electromagnetic surface waves stems from their potential applications in nanoscale opto-electronic devices.  In contrast to the Sommerfeld-Zenneck analyses emphasising radio frequencies, modern studies at optical frequencies usually take Raether's influential treatise, *Surface Plasmons on Smooth and Rough Surfaces and on Gratings* as their point of departure.  The modern terminology for the Zenneck wave at the interface between a metal and a dielectric is the surface plasmon or the surface plasmon-polariton (SPP).  At optical frequencies the surface plasmon exhibits strong spatial localisation at the dielectric-conductor interface and can be simply and efficiently excited by appropriately polarised light incident on surfaces decorated with physical features (slits, holes, grooves, etc.) at the subwavelength scale (tens to hundreds of nanometres). Here, we consider the interface between two media, one dielectric and the other a metallic conductor.  Each material is characterised by a relative permittivity, $\\epsilon_r$: $\\epsilon_r^d$ for the dielectric insulator and $\\epsilon_r^m$ for the conducting metal.  In order to lighten notation we drop the subscript $r$ and write the relative permittivities (dielectric constants) as $\\epsilon_d$ and $\\epsilon_m$ for the dielectric and metal, respectively.  The metal also exhibits a high conductivity, $\\sigma$ and obeys *Ohm's law* $\\mathbf{E}=\\sigma\\mathbf{J}$ where $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field applied to the metal and $\\mathbf{J}$ is the current density induced in it.  We consider the dielectric medium as essentially transparent (lossless) so that $\\epsilon_d=\\epsilon_d^{\\prime}$ where $\\epsilon_d^{\\prime}$ is real. In the case of metallic materials absorptive loss in the optical region of the electromagnetic spectrum is significant, the dielectric constant is complex, and $\\epsilon_m=\\epsilon_m^{\\prime}+i\\epsilon_m^{\\prime\\prime}$, where the imaginary term represents absorptive loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows two orthogonal linear polarisation orientations of E-M fields incident on the metal surface.  Although in our discussion of space propagating waves the direction of propagation is always along $z$, in this discussion we must consider both the incident propagating wave and the surface wave.  The incident space-propagating wave is taken to be incident along $z$, while the surface wave propagates along $x$.  The plane of incidence is defined by the incident and reflected plane-wave propagation vectors $\\mathbf{k}$, and in the figure below this plane is aligned with the $x-z$ plane.  With $\\mathbf{H}$ perpendicular to the plane of incidence (right panel of the figure) the polarisation is called *transverse-magnetic* (TM).  TM polarisation restricts the incident wave to field components $E_x,E_z,H_y$.  With $\\mathbf{E}$ perpendicular to the same plane (left panel of the figure) the polarisation is *transverse-electric* (TE).   The field components of a TE polarised wave are $H_x,H_z,E_y$.  We will consider continuity conditions at the surface for each case.\n",
