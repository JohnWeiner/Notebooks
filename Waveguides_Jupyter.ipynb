    "Up to now we have considered the elements of electromagnetics in terms of electric and magnetic vector force fields related by Maxwell's equations.  We have seen that the two time-varying equations, Faraday's Law and the Maxwell-Amp\\`ere Law, give rise to electromagnetic wave solutions that propagate through a medium or, as we saw in the case of surface plasmons, at the interface between media.  These solutions are generally distributed through out a spatial extent large with respect to the characteristic wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast the conventional radio and microwave circuit theory of electrical engineering considers time-varying electromagnetic phenomena from the standpoint of various combinations of *lumped elements*, (capacitors, inductors, resistors) localised in space and linked by interconnects of negligible impedance.  Furthermore, the spatial extent of these circuit elements, together with their sources of voltage and current, oscillating from tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, is usually much smaller than the characteristic wavelength.  The result is that all the elements of the circuits are subject to the same time dependence without retardation.  This time behaviour is termed *quasistatic*,and the physical arrangement of the circuit can be said to be *subwavelength*.  The subwavelength scaling similarity between dielectric and metallic nanostructures interacting with optical driving fields and electrical circuits driven by conventional voltage and current oscillators suggests that circuit analysis might find useful application in the design of functional plasmonic and photonic devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuit theory is essentially the application of Maxwell's equations to problems commonly encountered in electrical engineering.  The conditions that validate circuit theory are: (1) that electrical effects happens instantaneously throughout the circuit---the quasistatic approximation, (2) that the *net* charge on every component is null, and (3) that magnetic couplings between or among lumped components of the circuit are negligible.  A typical circuit comprising a source, resistor, capacitor and inductor are shown in the figure below.\n"
