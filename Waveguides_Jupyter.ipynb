    "Up to now we have considered the elements of electromagnetics in terms of electric and magnetic vector force fields related by Maxwell's equations.  We have seen that the two time-varying equations, Faraday's Law and the Maxwell-Ampère Law, give rise to electromagnetic wave solutions that propagate through a medium or, as we saw in the case of surface plasmons, at the interface between media.  These solutions are generally distributed through out a spatial extent large with respect to the characteristic wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast the conventional radio and microwave circuit theory of electrical engineering considers time-varying electromagnetic phenomena from the standpoint of various combinations of *lumped elements*, (capacitors, inductors, resistors) localised in space and linked by interconnects of negligible impedance.  Furthermore, the spatial extent of these circuit elements, together with their sources of voltage and current, oscillating from tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, is usually much smaller than the characteristic wavelength.  The result is that all the elements of the circuits are subject to the same time dependence without retardation.  This time behaviour is termed *quasistatic*,and the physical arrangement of the circuit can be said to be *subwavelength*.  The subwavelength scaling similarity between dielectric and metallic nanostructures interacting with optical driving fields and electrical circuits driven by conventional voltage and current oscillators suggests that circuit analysis might find useful application in the design of functional plasmonic and photonic devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuit theory is essentially the application of Maxwell's equations to problems commonly encountered in electrical engineering.  The conditions that validate circuit theory are: (1) that electrical effects happens instantaneously throughout the circuit---the quasistatic approximation, (2) that the *net* charge on every component is null, and (3) that magnetic couplings between or among lumped components of the circuit are negligible.  A typical circuit comprising a source, resistor, capacitor and inductor are shown in the figure below.\n"

    "Up to now we have studied plane waves in and transmission lines.  Waves propagating within or on  guiding structures, which essentially define the transverse field boundary conditions, are related to unbounded plane waves and are even more closely related to transmission lines.  But guided waves also exhibit unique characteristics that require extension of our familiar ideas of voltage, current, capacitance and inductance.  Wave guiding at microwave frequencies was developed for radar during WWII, but now integrated optical circuits at the nanoscale use waveguides to transport optical signals onto and around integrated microchips.  We discuss in this section the elements of waveguide theory and the relation guided waves bear to plane electromagnetic waves and to transmission lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prototypical transmission line, consisting of two parallel slab conductors separated by a dielectric, is shown in the figure above.  In a sense this structure can be considered a wave guide since the E-field terminates on the two conducting slabs separated by a constant distance in the $y-z$ plane, although the H-field is unbounded along $y$.  It is clear from the front and side views, that the E- and H-field lines are confined to the $x-y$ plane with no field components along the direction of propagation, $z$.  Waves with this property are called *transverse electromagnetic* (TEM) waves.  An ideal plane wave propagating in space also exhibits phase fronts confined to the plane orthogonal to the propagation direction, so they are TEM waves as well.  Note that if we added two conducting slabs in the $x-z$ plane so as to enclose a volume with a single conductor of rectangular $x-y$ cross-section, no TEM field could exist since the four conducting sides would define an interior space of constant voltage (and hence a null E-field).  However, *waveguides* with rectangular, cylindrical, and even arbitrarily shaped cross-section do exist, but in order to understand them we have to extend our ideas beyond the familiar TEM wave.  Waves propagating within structures of a single conductor are classified into two types: *transverse electric* (TE) waves with an H-field component along the propagation direction $z$ (but E-field only in the transverse $x-y$ plane), and *transverse magnetic* (TM) waves with an E-field component along the propagation direction (but only with transverse H-field components).  Note that TE and TM *waves* (or modes) should not be confused with TE and TM *polarisation* discussed at length in the Jupyter notebook on Surface Waves."

    "Here we apply the formal development of the last section to a simple but very useful example, the parallel plate waveguide.  This structure is essentially the same as the parallel plate transmission line studied in Section \\ref{section-LosslessTransLine}, but here we will see that the transmission line TEM waves (with no field components in the direction of propagation) can be be complemented with TE modes and TM modes.  The two conducting plates of the waveguide are separated by $s$ between the plates (along the $x$ direction) and have a width $w$ (along the $y$ direction) that is much greater than the separation $s$.  We can therefore assume that the solutions we seek will not be functions of $y$."

    "The cylindrical geometry is important not only for waveguides and transmission lines in the conventional microwave domain but also for nano-scale holes and hole arrays in the visible and near infrared regions.  A sensible point of departure for understanding light transmission through these cylindrically symmetric structures is an analysis of the field modes they can support.  The procedure is really no different than what we have done for the rectangular wave guides.  We choose a coordinate system in which the solutions to the Helmholtz equation will separate, and we will be able to write the solutions to $E_z$ and $H_z$ as a product of three factors $R(r)\\Phi(\\varphi)e^{i\\beta z}$ where $R(r)$ is the radial field dependence and $\\Phi(\\varphi)$ is the azimuthal angular dependence around the $z$ axis.  A schematic of the guide is shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{Fig-Cylinder}"
